# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow (tutorial).  This is part of my student portfolio.  I am Michael J Teegarden, a student transitioning from my former career (in public education) to hopefully a new career (in backend or python development).  I am taking courses from both Dallas College (in Texas) and online.  I'm studying such topics as Python, Kotlin, GoLang, Javascript, Visual Studio Code, Git and GitHub, and SQL (PostgreSQL).
