# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow (tutorial).  This is part of my student portfolio.  I am Michael J Teegarden, a student transitioning from my former career (in public education) to hopefully a new career (in backend or python development).  I am taking courses from both Dallas College (in Texas) and online.  I'm studying such topics as Python (upper intermediate), Kotlin (beginner), GoLang (beginner), Javascript (beginner), Visual Studio Code (beginner), Git and GitHub (beginner), and SQL (PostgreSQL) (beginner).
